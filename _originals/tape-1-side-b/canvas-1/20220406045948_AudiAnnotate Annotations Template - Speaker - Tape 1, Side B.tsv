31	48	"For a class on film to use that film and the book and the screenplay, just to really show how these things work and how they can be changed."
74	108	"I know some people have a problem with this, but I was never—I didn't feel threatened by collaboration. I was excited by it. It amused me to see how people—to see peoples' take on certain things, and I kind of knew we were creating something different. I guess what I really was concerned about was that it keep all the heart and the spirit."
113	120	Walker expresses regret that the character Mister is not "embraced" at the end of the film adaptation.
140		Walker says actor Danny Glover "did a fine thing" by researching her grandfather to prepare for his role in the film.
175	180	Walker says <em>Meridian</em> would become a movie "one day"—she hopes.
188	244	Walker explains that she thinks the civil rights movement should be told "from a personal point of view".
220	244	"What about the girls who were just coming to life at that time and understanding what was happening, what the possibility was for a different kind of life? What about the young men who were beaten up so badly or were killed? What about their love relationships, their relationships with their parents?
244	267	"When I was writing [<em>Meridian</em>], I was really very conscious of wanting to leave a record of the interior life—because I figured we'd all see enough of firehoses and dogs and police and [indistinct]—but we wouldn't see those little acts of heroism."
267	291	Walker explains that a mayor in Mississippi displayed a tank ("Thompson's tank") to intimidate civil rights activists.
295	307	Facing the real threat of violence in the South "was preferable to feeling afraid in the North and not being able to go home."
307	360	Walker explains that most of her siblings left the South and never returned.
414	447	"I think it's another kind of gfit—that sometimes when you're wounded, or you have such incredible suffering, your people are put in concentration camps or your people are lynched or your people are disappeared—you know, what do you do with it? What do you do with it? If you can't make art, what are you gonna do?"
446		Walker laughs.
450		Walker says that repression of suffering can lead people to commit suicide or abuse others.
486	522	Walker and Gussow discuss why someone might not share their trauma—shame, embarrassment, "maybe a degree of disbelief".
531	598	"I remember when I was going around talking about female genital mutilation, especially in London, where they had recently—they were trying to pass a law to stop it from happening in London. And I remember an African woman once saying to me that she was upset because I was working on this, she said because now every time someone sees an African woman on the street, this is what they'll be thinking, and how embarrassing and how humiliating—and it is. However, so I said to her, well, what is the alternative? What is the alternative? And we just sat there with that between us. Because the alternative is that you do nothing and then every African woman you see, or so many that you see, will have been wounded as children and nobody will have said a thing about it and it'll just keep going on."
618	653	On why her political beliefs don't necessarily push her to keep up a writing career: "Maybe what's being born is something that's not so interested in adversity. Or maybe what's being born is something that wants to just go and be with the adversity and not write about it. Just be the person who's there to hold somebody, I mean, that's important. And sometimes I think that's where writing is leading. Which is fine—just drop the pen and grab the person."
654		Walker laughs.
676	792	Walker is asked how her poetry and her fiction are related; she says that poetry "often comes first" and "sends a signal" for later development through fiction.

783	792	"When I thought I was, quote, just writing poetry, I was also marking these places that needed to be looked at more."
809	858	Walker says she "can't really" stop writing poetry while she works on novels or short stories, though she does write less poetry at those times because she's "so present" for the events of the novel—"although sometimes the characters write poetry."
815	831	"Of all of them, poetry is the most free. It just chooses its own time. And I just hope I'm there to get it."
852		Walker laughs.
884		Walker describes her experience on the Rose O'Donnell Show earlier that day, where they discussed Mae West and being "trapped in your reputation".

898		Walker laughs.
911		Walker laughs.

1065		Walker groans.
1069	1096	"When I was a student at Spelman, right after my freshman year, I went to Russia. And I was so innocent, I didn't really know hardly what was going on. So when I came back, I took this course with Howard Zinn, who was teaching Russian literature and language—not that he spoke it, really, but he had a few words and he very generously taught it to us."
1104	1127	"I used to think that Russian writers, that what they could do was almost unbelievable. Creating worlds, societies, human anguish, passion—and Tolstoy is just a master."
1161	1250	"I think the thing is I really fell in love with Tolstoy himself in the same way that I love my grandfather. They were so much alike, which, is, again, ironic, because he was Count Tolstoy and my grandfather was a poor farmer. But in terms of how they grew, very similar. Tolstoy was really a rogue and a devil when he was young. And in fact, one of the sadder things about him is that he raped some of the serfs, the women, who lived on his, basically, his plantation. And he was just a dissolute, irresponsible cad of a person as a young man. And then he started seeing how it all goes, what life is. And he grew and grew and grew until he became this old man who didn't want to own anything, who didn't want to be married and died alone, trying to get away."
1170		Walker laughs.
1253		"Did you know that when people are dying, they often try to run away?"

1264	1294	Walker voices an interest in end of life care and "hospice work".
1378	1347	On Tolstoy: "I love him because he could see that he was the whole spectrum. And he was able to write about the whole spectrum from the point of view of someone who had done some really despicable things. Maybe I just like rascals."

1481		Walker laughs.
1516		"What I'm learning is that the indigenous take on everything is just so different from the western thought."
1528		Walker names <em>Black Elk Speaks</em> as one of her favorites and reflects on the importance of visions in the culture depicted in that book.
1505	1595	"When you are given a vision, a great vision—and it's not great in terms of bigger than anybody else's, it's your great vision... your little great vision—you have to act it out. You have to create it so that people can see it and use it. That's how you keep it going. You can't keep it for yourself."
1637		Walker says she probably won't return to the Amazon because the trip was very difficult.
1642		Walker says she now has "so much empathy" for peoples living in the Amazon.
1712	1724	On the rainforest: "It's never quiet. And at night, the frogs are so loud it's like you're living right by a train station. I'd never thought of that."

1768		Walker laughs.
1778		Walker laughs.
1781	1813	"I'm looking at the liveliness of your eyes, and I think [meditation] would do a lot. You're obviously really alive anyway, but meditation sort of fuels that. It helps it to really stay steady. And it gives you a little time each day to duck out so you can recharge that."
1815		Walker coughs.
1819		"Tell 'em Alice sent you."
1839	1842	"Violence and drugs are both really, in my opinion, really obsolete."

2129		"It's an emotional mangling."
2149		"I know in this culture people think that this is the only lifetime we're here—I don't think so."
2158		Walker laughs.
2149	2242	Walker discusses her personal beliefs regarding life and death.
2175		Walker laughs.

2255		"I feel lighter not carrying hatred."
2280	2308	"I never thought I'd reach this age. I thought I would be dead by 30 either from suicide or assassination or homicide or something. So the last 26 years have felt like a miracle."
2324		Walker says she never imagined as a child she would be a writer.
2340	2388	Walker says she's "thinking about singing" like she's observed people do in Mexico, for the sake of music.

2680		Walker laughs.
2702	2764	On Walker's mother calling her "a mess" before she died: "It meant she was seeing me for the first time. The real me. Not the really super good girl. Because I ahve always been so polite and respectful... it was hard for my mother to ever—becasue seh wasn't an intellectual—it was hard for her to see that I was also subversive and rebellious.... on her death bed, she got it. That all these years she'd been dealing with someone who very much had her own mind."
2783		Walker mentions what she calls her mother's "fundamentalism".
