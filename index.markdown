<p>Alice Walker is an American writer, educator, and social activist. She is the author of over 30 novels, nonfiction books, and poetry collectionsâ€”but she is best known by far for her novel <em>The Color Purple</em>, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1982. The book was adapted into an award-winning movie directed by Stephen Spielberg in 1985, as well as a Broadway musical in 2005.</p>
  
<p>Much of Walker's work centers on the lives of Black women in America, particularly in the South, and the racism and sexism they face on a daily basis.</p>
  
<p>In 2000, Walker met with <em>New York Times</em> journalist Mel Gussow for an interview which led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/26/books/explorer-human-terrain-once-again-alice-walker-ready-embrace-her-freedom-change.html">this article</a>. The interview was recorded; the tapes are held at UT Austin's <a href="https://hrc.utexas.edu">Harry Ransom Center</a> and are available online through their <a href="https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/">digital collections</a>. Below, you can listen to these tapes and read through annotations provided by Kayleigh Voss, a graduate student at UT Austin who works both at the Ransom Center and for the AudiAnnotate project.</p>
