<p>Alice Walker was born in Eatonton, Georgia, in 1944. She was the youngest of eight children; both her parents worked as sharecroppers. After graduating as valedictorian of her high school, she enrolled first at Spelman College, but later transferred to Sarah Lawrence College.</p>
  
<p>Walker published several novels, books of poetry, blah blah blah...</p>
  
<p>In 2000, Walker met with <em>New York Times</em> journalist Mel Gussow for an interview which led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/26/books/explorer-human-terrain-once-again-alice-walker-ready-embrace-her-freedom-change.html">this article</a>. The interview was recorded; the tapes are held at UT Austin's <a href="https://hrc.utexas.edu">Harry Ransom Center</a> and are available online through their <a href="https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/">digital collections</a>. Below, you can listen to these tapes and read through annotations provided by Kayleigh Voss, a graduate student at UT Austin who works both at the Ransom Center and for the AudiAnnotate project.</p>
